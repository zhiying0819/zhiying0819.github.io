          My classmates and I are building a simulated landscape, which is a model that shrinks according to the scale of the
          school. And simulate the weather. One of the ways to imitate the meteor shower is to sprinkle sparkling powder on the
          building.
        <br><br>
          I forgot some details, then is the next day.
          <br><br>
          At sunset, we found that the distant horizon began to show a beautiful galactic effect. So we took photos one after
          another. But when I guided several boys to take photos, a huge pink planet with a star ring appeared in the Milky Way
          (pink Jupiter + star ring). Oh, my God, we were all stunned. I took a video for nostalgia. I wanted to send it
          to everyone on the Internet to tell then that this is not fake or synthetic. It's true.
          <br><br>
          At this time, it rained lightly in the sky, and everyone was enjoying a beautiful atmosphere. I found that it
          was not raining in the sky, but a little shining particles, and floating inclined to an incredible angle. I looked at
          the pink planet - the twinkling particles, which came from it. The density between the particles is getting bigger and
          larger, and some people can't breathe. Something has begun to be wrong. It has become a storm. Everyone started to run
          into a building. My friends and I found masks in the cabinet on the first floor. This is something left over from the
          previous coronavirus epidemic. We all put it on. The windows in the building were shattered, and strong winds and
          heavy rains ravaged. Suddenly, tentacles appeared outside the building, sweeping away the people who had time to run
          into the building in the future. I don't know which direction they were swept in, nor did they swept away. We all
          gathered in a corner on the first floor, and the door couldn't be closed. A friend of mine was trying to pull the wire
          to close the door, but no one helped her. (Rest of the dream was very blurred, so I woke up and quickly wrote down the previous
          text.)
          <br><br>
          Everyone feels safe in this building, but there is one thing: we don't know what's going on outside, we don't know
          where the tentacles are, or what's behind the wall and our backs. We can only wait until the storm stops.
          Before that, we can only get together to keep warm. Then I woke up.

          New Journey to The West
          <br><br>
          Sun Wukong, Sha Wujing and a pig embarked on the road to learn scriptures in the west... Sun Wukong seems to have
          wings to fly. We are still a case-solving team (?).
          <br><br>
          When they came to a canyon, the big black and white stones looked abrupt in the middle. Their existence was very
          unusual, but there was no credible reason to explain their appearance in this inaccessible place.
          <br><br>
          But we found several bodies nearby. There was no sound in the silent canyon, so the Monkey King carried me into the
          sky and planned to find out. At first, we didn't find anything. We only knew that the temperament emitted in this
          place was very similar to that of a case we encountered before. Suddenly, I saw the staggered arrangement of black and
          white stones: this is a game of chess. Although we still don't understand what this chess game is for, at least we
          nodded, so we flew around and found that the canyon was a bit like a courtyard structure. The front hall is a tourist
          attraction, and there will be tourists to take photos or something, but no one cares in the back (chess game).
          <br><br>
          I don't know why we found a dungeon (not closed) near the chess game, so we rested here. Everything was a little
          unusual. We went out quietly at night to explore. As we skimmed everywhere in the low altitude, someone suddenly came
          out (in the middle of the night). They found us. At first, they looked very flustered and began to sweat all over, as
          if they had been tricked. Somehow, we found a way to wake up these people: shake their faces with clothes... Some
          people joined our army of face-shaking after waking up. Finally, everyone woke up!
